### 🎯 Key Features

- **Modern React Frontend** with animations and responsive design
- **Mock Data Fallback** - works even without backend running
- **Admin Panel** for content management
- **Contact Form** functionality
- **Professional Design** with smooth animations

### 🛠️ How to Use

#### Option 1: Use the Batch File (Windows)
Simply double-click `start-servers.bat` to start both servers automatically.

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. **Backend**: `cd backend` → `python manage.py runserver 8000`
2. **Frontend**: `cd frontend` → `npm start`

#### Option 3: Frontend Only
The React app works standalone with mock data - just run `npm start` in the frontend directory.
