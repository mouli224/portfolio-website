## Tips for Best Results:
1. Use high-quality images with good lighting
2. Crop images to focus on key features
3. Maintain consistent aspect ratios (4:3 recommended)
4. Optimize file sizes for web (aim for under 500KB per image)
5. Use descriptive alt text for accessibility

## After Adding Images:
1. Restart the development server
2. Clear browser cache if images don't load
3. Test on different devices and screen sizes
